\section{Research Interests}
\cventry{}{}{}{}{}{My research interests fall within the fields of Natural Language Processing, Social Network Analysis and Machine Learning.
I'm particularly interested in using large amounts of structured and unstructured language data to help machines understand natural language.
My PhD research was focused on combining text and network information in a semi-supervised setting to learn user demographics and 
specifically Twitter user geolocation which resulted in state-of-the-art geolocation performance published in ACL, NAACL and EMNLP.}
\section{Education}

\cventry{2014--2017}{PhD in Computer Science (Expected Dec 2017)}{The University of Melbourne}{Melbourne, Australia}{}{Thesis: Geolocation of Social Media Users Exploiting Both Text and Network Information.}  % Arguments not required can be left empty
\cventry{2010--2013}{MSc. Computational Linguistics}{Sharif University of Technology}{Tehran, Iran}{}{}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{2016--2017}{Internship (5 months)}{\textsc{Telstra TELCO}}{Melbourne, Australia}{}{
My internship was on customer intent prediction in interactive voice response (IVR) systems based on 
historical events (website visits, previous calls). My work involved working with technologies like GreenPlum and Theano to create learning models that can predict the intent of a customer 
(e.g. talking about billing, a problem with their Smart TV service or a failing modem) 
from their previous events (e.g. page visit, previous calls, previous bill) using classification, language modelling and association rules which improved routing of customers to agents
resulting in customer satisfaction and cost reduction.
The CTO of the company mentioned the results of my work in a general meeting and supported the investment of the company in the same line of work to improve customer experience.
}


%------------------------------------------------

\cventry{2013--2014}{Researcher}{\textsc{Linneaus University}}{Stockholm, Sweden}{}{
I was a member of Sentiment Analysis team which focused on the study of stance/sentiment in 
big data real-time text streams like Twitter. My job involved working on Vector Space Models, 
Feature Extraction and Classification/Clustering of Stance/Sentiment in real time big data streams.
}

\cventry{2011--2013}{Java/MapReduce Developer}{\textsc{MITRC}}{Tehran, Iran}{}{
I was responsible for a team of 4 developers working on the crawler component of a large scale web search engine. 
I could improve the crawler's performance from just 1 million fetched URLs to 1 billion at the end. 
The crawler had about 2 billion URLs where 1 billion ones were fetched and updated regularly. 
The data was about 30 TB. We used Hadoop's HDFS, MapReduce and HBase. 
We built our web crawler on top of Apache Nutch, an open source popular web crawler.
}
\cventry{2006--2011}{Software Developer and System Administrator}{\textsc{KECO}}{Tehran, Iran}{}{
Main responsibilities include: Software Development (Web and Desktop) using .NET (C\# and ASP) and 
MSSQL. Cisco Switching Administrator (50+ access switches and 4 distribution switches in a 2 tier network architecture, 
500+ nodes, vlan, portsec, spanning-tree, redundancy, architecture, load balancing, high-availability), Windows Network Administrator 
(Active Directory, High Availability, Centralized Management), ERP Administrator (Supply Chain, Salary, HR), Microsoft SQL Server Administrator and Developer.
I learned to work with technology under heavy pressure where a medium sized company (2k+ users) relies on your design and administration 24/7.
